# Embedded_Systems_Advanced_egFWD-_Scholarship_project_1
Control blinking of an LED for a user-defined ON and OFF periods  Create a function in the App layer that takes as an input from the user a specific ON time and OFF time in seconds, lights a LED for the given ON time, and dim it for the given OFF time. Itâ€™s prohibited to use predefined delay functions, only timer driver functions can be used. This function implements implicitly the PWM module using Timer Overflow.


## Prepare project folders

Create a COTS folder for the whole course including a folder for each layer in the layered architectureto include MCAL,HAL,SERVICE,APPLICATION and LIBRARIES

Provide a screenshot of your COTS folder with the stated arrangement

## Implement the GPIO driver

> 1-Create the GPIO driver from scratch using the sufficient interface,configure,private and program files
2-Create functions in GPIO driver that are needed to perform the required project functionality
Provide a screen recording of GPIO driver, explaining its functions and Macros, and how each function will help to achieve the functionality of the project (Maximum 3 minutes)

## Implement Timer driver

1-Create the Timer driver from scratch using the sufficient interface,configure,private and program files
2-Create functions in Timer driver that are needed to perform the required project functionality
3-Creating a Timer Overflow ISR that performs the required functionality
Passing the ISR as a callback function from App Layer to Timer driver in MCAL layer
Provide a screen recording of TIMER driver, explaining its functions and Macros, and how each function will help to achieve the functionality of the project (Maximum 4 minutes)

## Implement interrupt driver

1-Creating the Interrupt driver from scratch using the sufficient interface,configure,private and program files
2-Create functions in Interrupt driver that are needed to perform the required project functionality
Provide a screen recording of Interrupt driver, explaining its functions and Macros, and how each function will help to achieve the functionality of the project (Maximum 2 minutes)

## Test your application

1-Deliver a screen recording of your code (main.c), and run it while showing the Tiva C board simulator showing how the LED status would vary by changing the ON/OFF time in runtime. (Maximum 3 minutes)
